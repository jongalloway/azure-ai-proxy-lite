# VS Code Foundry Toolkit

The [VS Code Foundry Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-windows-ai-studio.windows-ai-studio) extension is the first-class experience for prototyping and experimenting with AI models and agents through the Azure AI Proxy. It provides a rich, interactive environment for attendees to explore chat completions, test prompts, connect to MCP Servers, and interact with AI agents — all from within VS Code.

## Why the Foundry Toolkit?

- **Prototype with models**: Quickly experiment with different Azure OpenAI and Foundry models, adjust parameters, and iterate on prompts without writing code.
- **Explore AI agents**: Connect to Azure AI Foundry Agents through the proxy and interact with agents, assistants, and conversations directly.
- **Use MCP Servers**: Discover and connect to MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers surfaced through the proxy.
- **No setup required**: Attendees just need VS Code and their event API key — no Azure subscription or model deployment needed.

## Getting started

1. Install the [Foundry Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-windows-ai-studio.windows-ai-studio) in VS Code.
1. Register for an event to obtain your API key and the proxy endpoint URL.

    - In the models option, click **+**
    - A new menu will pop up, select **Add Custom Model**
    - Next, add in your model endpoint > model name as in the API > Model display name > api key
    - Your model will be added successfully & you can test it out in the playground

## For event organizers

Event organizers can add resources of type **Foundry Toolkit** in the admin portal to surface models to attendees via the extension. Foundry Toolkit resources are listed on the attendee registration page so users can easily configure the extension.

For details on adding Foundry Toolkit resources, see [Configuring resources](resources.md#adding-foundry-toolkit-models).
